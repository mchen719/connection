<h4>Main Concept: </h4>
<div>As a user, I want to be able to make and search job postings on this professional social networking app. I want to be able to manage my account, view other users' profiles, make and view posts, and make a lasting 'connection' with people who I'd like to add to my network. I want to be able to converse with anyone on the app through live chat messaging.</div>

<h3>~Locally cloned instructions~</h3>
<p>After successfully forking and cloning the source repo, navigate via terminal command line to your cloned folder location. When in the cloned folder, create an env file with the following command: </p>

```
npm i
```
<br>

```
touch .env
```

<p>Then to open up your project folder to view code and make necessary edits to the env file, type the following in the command line: </p>

```
code .
```


<p>Navigate to your env file while your project is opened in vs code and populate the env file with the following data, making sure to replace the template phrases in the below tags with your specific data...</p>

```
MONGO_URI=<enterLinkInformationToYourMongDBdatabase>
SECRET=<enterSHA-256-SECRET-encryptionToPreferredSecretPassword>
SEED_PASSWORD=<yourPreferredStarterAccountPasswords>
PORT=<yourPreferredPortNumber>
```

SECRET <strong>must</strong> be a sha256 hash. Link to hashing site <a href="https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/sha256.html">HERE</a>.
<br>Once your .env is correctly created, SAVE FILE<br><br>

<h4>NODE VERSION REQUIREMENTS:</h4>
In order to run this program you must have Node version 20 installed and running on your device.
<br>
<h4>Necessary packages to install<h4>
<br> Type the following verbatim into terminal's command line while in working project folder to install relevant packages:<br>

```
npm i
```

<h4>Almost There!</h4>
<p>You'll want to initiate your seed file before starting the server. Make sure that you've correctly input the requested data in your env file before proceeding, then type the following command in your project folder's terminal command line: </p>

```
npm run seed
```

<h5>Presto! Fully seeded application!</h5>
<p>Don't like the seed file and want to start from scratch? Sure thing! If you've already installed seed file or else populated your local database with unwanted data, clear the pallet and start fresh with the following command: </p>

```
npm run seedDeleter
```


<h4>Server running instructions: </h4>

<p>To run the application on dev server: </p>

```
npm run dev
```
